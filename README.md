# Store-Sales---Time-Series-Forecasting
In this project  the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores must be predicted.
Before starting the feature engineering, I've done some pre-preparations and then performed EDA to get some insights about original features and their interactions.
Three models are used to predict unit sales: lgbm, XGBoost and Keras. The best perfomer was XGBoost with rmsle equal to 0.447
ensemble of the three models results an remsle of 0.44488.
